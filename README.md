# Covid19, Time Series Data 

 In this project the entire time series analysis workflow is performed. I used the COVID19 dataset for United States that consists of the data related a cumulative number of confirmed and deaths cases. This work contains all parts of Time Series data analysis and forecasting. There are 3 files in this repository 
 
- Aggregate Functions: 
  - Data Introducing with simple visualization. How does US Spread of the virus look like?
  - Used Plotly module in order to plot some insightful and intuitive graphs 
  - Visual analysis of all Components of  Time Series Data: Trend, Seasonality and Cycles
  
- Statmodels:
  - Part 1: Does covid19 vaccination have actually an impact on COVID19 spread? And How?
  - Mathematically determining patterns in Time Series
  - Decompose Data to Trend, Season and Errors
  
- Forecasting:
  - Trend is identified and removed using **statsmodels** module and **DeterministicProcess** method
  - Forcasting using **SARIMAX**
  - Forcasting using Meta's Prophet Model with and whithout trend
  - Forecasting using XGBoost Model
  - Forecasting using Simple Neural Network with Keras
